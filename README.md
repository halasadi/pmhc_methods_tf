This Repo contains code to train a machine-learning peptide-MHC binding model on publicly available data, with little restrictions on the license. 

I aim to train a

#1) XgBoost Model to benchmark performance
#2) Neural Network model with self-attention to better handle data from differing peptide lengths, which I hope to do by positional encoding.
